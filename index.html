<p> My dad was the cook in my house. Often when I get home from middle school and high school
  you could smell whatever my dad had decided to make for dinner and it brought water to your mouth and tears to your eyes becuase you knew it was going to be good.
  If you come to my apartment now...you would not have the same effect. Sadly,
  his cooking skills went to my brother, not to I. That being said, Below is a way to one of my greatest college inventions thus far! I promies once you follow these steps,
  not only will you not die from the food, but in fact you will have a delicious meal that you will either share or keep all for yourself.

      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <p> There is not a lot of needed materials, but for the sake of being clear later on,
        I thought this to be a helpful tip.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1 cutting board</li>
        <li>1 meduim sized pot</li>
        <li>1 mildy sharp knife</li>
        <li>1 meduim sized frying pan</li>
      </ul>

        <section class="list" id="ingredients">
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>These ingredients are pretty simple and stright forward, making it
        perfect for a college meal that needs to be made on the run,
        or late at night!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Chicken Apple Sausages</li>
        <li> 4 cups of White Rice (you can also use Brown)</li>
        <li>1-2 cups of duck sauce (the amount depends on how much rice you make)</li>
          </ul>
          </section>
      <section class="list" id="preparation">
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p> Much like the ingredients, preparation for this meal is pretty easy.
        The hardest part is timing each thing right so the all come together at the same time.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>First step isto get water boiling for your rice. Fill the pot till about half and let it boil before adding your cups of rice.
        This is the first step because it will take about 15-20mins for the rice to soak up all the water. </li>
        <li>While this is happening, grab the cutting board and sharp knife discussed about earlier.
          Chop the two sausages, the first cuts should make them into round bites.
          Cut them again so that they look like small little triangles,they will blend into the food easier this way.</li>
        <li>Drop the sausages into the frying pan, turn your stove to 4-5 and let those cook for 8mins or until they have a golden brown layer to them.</li>
        <li>Your rice should be done by now, if not give it a few more minutes and turn down your heat on the frying pan to one.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the sausages to the rice, then add the 1-2 cups of duck sauce into the rice and sausage, stir until the duck sauce is fully embedded into the rice.</li>
        <li> And you are all set to share it, or if it's so good you choose not to share; you are all set in eating it all for yourself!</li>
        </ol>
